# A Tour of C++

Codes and drafts about my studies based on the book: *Bjarne Stroustrup, "A Tour of C++ (2018)"
Some solutions (and some comments) are also based on the book: *Scott Meyers, "Effective C++ (2005)"*.

Each chapter has a folder with some codes, comments, and tests.
All codes were developed by using CLion.
